# AWS_CDK
Welcome to my repo! As a new Cloud Engineer I use extensively IaaC with CDK from AWS. Though my journey I have found out that there are not many examples with python code out there.
Clone the repo and make the necessary changes to the code, in order to use it the way that suits you. There are comments in the files that guide you.
I hope this helps other fellow geeks :)
Enjoy!
